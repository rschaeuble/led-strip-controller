= ESP8266 based LED Strip Controller

== Main Components

ESP-WROOM-02::
+
--
Microcontroller with built-in WiFi.
--

PCA9685::
+
--
PWM LED controller with 16 channels and I^2^C bus interface.

As the ESP8266 does not have enough pins to drive 12 LED channels (3 * RGBW), a dedicated chip has to do this work.
--


== Power Supply

The circuit consists of two power nets: a 12{nbsp}V net for the LED strips and a 3.3{nbsp}V net for everything else.

The 12{nbsp}V are provided by an external power supply. The LED strips are directly connected to this power rail.

The 3.3{nbsp}V are provided by an on-circuit power regulator whose input is connected to the 12{nbsp}V rail.
With a voltage difference of about 9{nbsp}V and up to 500{nbsp}mA current draw by the ESP8266 alone,
a linear regulator is too inefficient, so a switching mode regulator is used.


.Current draw of individual components:
* ESP-WROOM-02: 500{nbsp}mA
* PCA9685: 10{nbsp}mA (just the chip, without any driven LEDs)
* One or two status LEDs: 40{nbsp}mA

Adding some buffer, an 800{nbsp}mA power supply should suffice easily.


== Design Consideration

This section is a collection of various design considerations.

=== Switch Mode Power Supply: build your own or buy (OPEN)

As this is my first real hardware project and given my complete lack of experience with switch mode power supplies,
I ruled out building my own regulator circuit (e.g. based on LM2595 or LM2675).
Instead, an all-in-one regulator module will be used.

=== Overload Protection for LED strips (OPEN)

If the LED strips connected to the controller draw more power than the power supply and/or the circuitry
can handle, this could potentially cause damage.

To prevent this, some kind of current limiter could be added to the circuitry feeding the LED strips.

.Open questions:
* How would the overcurrent protection work? Autonomous hardware, or with support from the firmware?
* How about a current meter (with a I^2^C interface) that the firmware could read out? The current power draw
  could be reported via MQTT, providing for a nice little feature.


=== ESD Protection

The following connections are accessible when the controller is inside a closed enclosure:

* LED strip connectors.
* Power supply jack.
* Programming lines:
** RX/TX
** GND
** Reset
** Firmware flashing mode selector

While ESD protection for a simple and cheap product as this is probably a bit overkill,
adding it would teach me something new, so I'll likely do it.

To do:

* Learn about different ESD protection techniques
** Diodes to V+, one to V-.
** Diodes only to V-.
* Extend schematic.
